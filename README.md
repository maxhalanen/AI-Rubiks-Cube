# AI-Rubiks-Cube
AI to solve a Rubiks Cube

**This is a personal project!**

So far i have only made the rubiks cube itself. I have not yet started exploring how to solve it using Artificial Intellegence.
I will probably remake the cube with numpy in the future, and also add some rudimentary ASCII GUI.
I am not sure what route to take in developing the AI (algorithms, machine learning), but algorithms definately seem like the easiest approach.
when it comes to solving the final layer of the rubiks cube, it does not seem to difficult, as that can be easily implemented with algorithms, the first two layers have much more possibilities on where the peices are situated.

i might try to solve the first two layers with machine learning however it is a daunting task since i am still learning the basics of ML.

EXCITED TO START!!!!
