# ML-Rubiks-Cube
Machine learning AI to solve a Rubiks Cube

**This is a personal project!**

So far i have only made the rubiks cube itself. I have not yet started exploring how to solve it using ML.
I will probably remake the cube with numpy in the future, and also add some rudimentary ASCII GUI.

EXCITED TO START!!!!
